 <h3>
    The Lord of the Rings
</h3>
 <p>
    Wonderful fantasy movie that brought to life one of the most amazing worlds in literature.
</p>

 <h3>
The Pirates of the Carribean
 </h3>
 <p>
    Exciting, action-packed, and witty series of swash-buckling movies. Except for the 7th installment. We don't talk about that.
 </p>
 
 <h3>
    Godfather 1 and 2
 </h3>
 <p>
    Excellent storytelling with rich characters. We don't talk about Godfather 3. Don't even watch Godfather 3.
